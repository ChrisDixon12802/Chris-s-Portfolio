        <p>Hello! My name is Chris and I'm an up-and-coming web developer.</p>

        <p class="goal">
          My passion is creating websites that are not only user-friendly but
          also the best a website can possibly be in terms of design and
          functionality. I want to make sure that every website I make is the
          best for any business or any individual that would need a website
          made.
